TrackOne is a rock cover band playing standards from all decades with a small bias to the 90s.
We play songs that you'll recognize the way they were recorded (mostly).
The guitars and bass are precise and the drumming on-point.
The vocals are a blend of clean melodies and natural distortion.

Mark and Mike had played together for a long time as part of a local band called Retrofit and, like everyone else, had to take a break from gigging in 2020 and 2021.
Ed, Adam and John joined the pair in 2022 to form TrackOne.
Our first gig was at The Bach Dor in April 2023.
We play about once a month at various local pubs and restaurants in Central CT.
