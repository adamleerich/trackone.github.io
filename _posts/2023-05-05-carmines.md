Our first gig at [Carmine's](http://www.carmines389.com/) was pretty awesome.
We didn't get any pictures of the crowd, unfortunately, but we had tons of friends, family, and coworkers come out.
A coworker's wife was celebrating her birthday with several friends who drank, danced, and sang till after the music stopped at 12:30am!
Of course we sang *Happy Birthday*. :)
Carmine, who loves to jump up to play with the band, sang lead on *Sweet Home Alabama* and played a sweet bluesy guitar solo.
