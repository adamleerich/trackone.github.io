Our first gig at Jerry's in Middletown on June 18 was a lot of fun.
The stage is inside the big windows at the front of the restaurant, so people driving by can see (and hear!) the band.
And it's a proper stage -- about 10" off the ground, nice solid floor.
Adam spent most of his time down on the floor with the patrons.
