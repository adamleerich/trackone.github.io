One of our absolute favorite songs.  A hard one to do becuase so many people, musicians or not,
know this song note-for-note and know when you screw it up!
We got the [first 30 seconds of Mark's guitar solo](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CyCb7hmB2no/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==) out on Instagram too.
If you like what you hear please share with a friend!
