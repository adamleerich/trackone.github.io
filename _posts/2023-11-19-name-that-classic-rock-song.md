These are pictures drawn by kids of a band member and given to him as a Christmas present in 2018.
Each one is meant to depict a famous classic rock song.
At the time they were drawn, the various artists ranged from three to fifteen years-old,
so some of the drawings are a little harder to figure out than the others.
But, they are all well-known songs -- how many can you get?

Match the number on each image to the list at the bottom of the page to check your answers.
