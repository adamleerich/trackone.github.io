We are playing at [Jerry's](https://jerrysct.com/) on Friday, February 23, for another gig and giveaway!
TrackOne is giving away another guitar and Jerry's will be throwing in some free food and drinks.

All you have to do to win is come hang out with us at Jerry's -- everyone who comes through the door while TrackOne is there gets a raffle ticket free of charge.
We'll pull numbers throughout the night for food and drinks, and then the big prize toward the end.
The big prize is an Ibanez Gio Mikro and case, courtesy of John from TrackOne.
